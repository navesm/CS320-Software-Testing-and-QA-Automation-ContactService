Java Contact Service with JUnit Tests


Through this project, it was beneficial to see how to properly address requirements validation and functionality through careful consideration for the purported deliverable product, but also for how to properly design the code before opening the editor, and considering the unit tests that will need to be developed before coding begins. Designing the software requires thinking about what it is that needs to be accomplished, and what that looks like with the particular language or technology being used. It is very much a different thing to solve a problem conceptually than it is to implement that solution in code.

Furthermore, it is so important to follow up the code that has been developed, and intentionally meeting requirements, by testing thoroughly with unit tests, as well as integration and end-to-end testing with the rest of the system, to ensure that not only are the requirements in fact being met, but is the code meeting them and behaving as expected, both when things go right and when edge cases and graceful errors are encountered.
